# Colour-Cube
Imagine instead of a colour wheel  you had a 3d cube that you can rotate and click the colour you want. This project showcases a 3D color cube visualization using Three.js. Users can explore different color combinations by interacting with the cubes. The application also includes OrbitControls for easy navigation.
